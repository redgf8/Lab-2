# Lab-2
DSA Lab 2

The purpose of this lab was to create three different implementations of a list interface. These would utilize linked list, circular linked list, and array structures respectively. Each would then be used to create its own playlist wrapper class, which would then all be tested against the other implementations to compare efficiency.

This project is currently being rewritten from its original version to improve design and efficiency.

# To do:
Rework circular linked list
Rewrite array from scratch
Convert test file to utilize JUnit tests
